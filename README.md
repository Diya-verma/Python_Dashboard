Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to gain actionable insights from raw sales data due to its complexity and volume. Traditional spreadsheets make it difficult to filter, visualize, and analyze performance across multiple dimensions such as region, state, city, category, and time.
The goal of this project is to build an interactive sales analysis dashboard using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly that allows users to:
- Upload their own sales dataset or use a sample dataset.
- Filter data dynamically by date range, region, state, and city.
- Visualize sales trends through bar charts, pie charts, line charts, treemaps, and scatter plots.
- Perform time-series analysis to track monthly and yearly sales performance.
- Explore hierarchical views of sales by region, category, and sub-category.
- Download filtered datasets and summaries for further offline analysis.
This dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for decision-makers to identify sales patterns, evaluate profitability, and make data-driven business strategies without requiring advanced technical skills.
